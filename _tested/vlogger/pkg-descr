vlogger is a little piece of code i wrote to handle dealing with large amounts
of virtualhost logs. its bad news to let apache deal with these itself (ask anyone who
runs a large webfarm about the interesting things apache does when it has 500 open logfiles)
so vlogger was born. it takes piped output from apache, splits off
the first field, and writes the logs to logfiles in subdirectories. it uses a file handle
cache so it can't run out of file descriptors. it will also start a new logfile every night
at midnight, and maintain a symlink to the most recent file. for security, it can drop privileges
and do a chroot to the logs directory.
