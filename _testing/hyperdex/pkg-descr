HyperDex is a next-generation key-value store with the following features:

Fast HyperDex has lower latency, higher throughput, and lower variance than
other key-value stores. Specifically, HyperDex is a factor of 2-14
faster than MongoDB, Cassandra and Redis on the industry-standard
YCSB benchmarks.

Searchable HyperDex enables lookups of non-primary data attributes. Such
searches are implemented efficiently and contact a small number of servers.

Scalable HyperDex scales as more machines are added to the system.

Consistent The value you GET is always the latest value you PUT. Not just
"eventually," but immediately and always.

Fault tolerant HyperDex handles failures. Data is automatically replicated
on multiple machines so that failures do not cause data loss
