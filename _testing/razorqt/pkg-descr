Razor-qt is an advanced, easy-to-use, and fast desktop environment based on Qt
technologies. It has been tailored for users who value simplicity, speed, and
an intuitive interface. Unlike most desktop environments, Razor-qt also works
fine with weak machines.
While still a new project, Razor-qt already contains the key DE components:
* Panel
* Desktop
* Application launcher
* Settings center
* Sessions
