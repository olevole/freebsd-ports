This is a set of MySQL UDFs (user defined functions) to work with
memcached using libmemcached. With these functions you get, set,
cas, append, prepend, delete, increment, decrement objects in
memcached, as well as set which servers to use and which behavior
the server connections will use. Combine these functions with
MySQL triggers and you can manage your memcached cache. The
library makes use of libmemcached. You can also use memcached
as a global sequence generator for MySQL by making use of the
increment function. These functions are compatible with all
versions of MySQL.
