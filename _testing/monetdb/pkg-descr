MonetDB  pioneered column-store solutions for high-performance data warehouses
for business intelligence and eScience since 1993. It achieves its goal by
innovations at all layers of a DBMS, e.g. a storage model based on vertical
fragmentation, a modern CPU-tuned query execution architecture, automatic and
adaptive indices, run-time query optimization, and a modular software
architecture. It is based on the SQL 2003 standard with full support for
foreign keys, joins, views, triggers, and stored procedures. It is fully ACID
compliant and supports a rich spectrum of programming interfaces (JDBC, ODBC,
PHP, Python, RoR, C/C++, Perl).
